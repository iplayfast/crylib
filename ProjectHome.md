This is a library that I've been creating for a number of years that is still under active development. The [idea](http://code.google.com/p/crylib/wiki/CryLib) is to use a standard streamable object as the base for the library. Objects created with this library include neural net, fuzzy object, classbuilder, xml parser, design pattern classes, as well as strings and lists etc.

The library does not use much STL, although this may change in the future. STL is used internally in the neural network class, as well as in some of the list and array classes.
